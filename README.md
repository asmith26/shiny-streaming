This repo holds a script for generating example streaming data, and a shiny application that updates periodly to visualise it.

To run:

1. In a terminal, run `Rscript generateExampleStreamingData.R` to generate example streaming data.
2. Run the shiny application.

(When finished, don't forget to exit the infinite loop from `generateExampleStreamingData.R`.)
